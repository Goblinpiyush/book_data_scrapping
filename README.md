Project Title:
Web Scraping : How to Scrape Book Data from a Website using Python

Post Content:

ðŸ“š Have you ever wondered how data from websites can be collected for analysis? Web scraping is a powerful technique that allows you to extract data from web pages, and itâ€™s a fundamental skill for data analysts and data scientists.

Today, Iâ€™ll guide you through a simple web scraping project where weâ€™ll scrape book titles and prices from a demo website: Books to Scrape. This tutorial is beginner-friendly, so if youâ€™re new to web scraping, itâ€™s a great place to start! ðŸ”¥

Technologies Used:

Python: The programming language we'll be using.

Requests: To send HTTP requests and receive HTML content from the website.

BeautifulSoup: To parse HTML and extract the required data.

ðŸ’¡Explanation of Each Step:
 Import Libraries:

1)We import requests to make HTTP requests to the website and BeautifulSoup from the bs4 library to help parse the HTML structure.
Define the URL:

2)Here, we define the URL of the website page we want to scrape. In this case, weâ€™re targeting the first page of the "Books to Scrape" site.
Send an HTTP Request:

3)We use requests.get(url) to send a GET request to the website. This fetches the HTML content of the page, which we can then pass to BeautifulSoup.
Parse the HTML:

4)BeautifulSoup(response.content, "html.parser") is used to parse the HTML content so that we can locate specific elements in the structure, such as book titles and prices.
Locate the Book Containers:

5)Each book on the page is contained within an HTML element with the class "product_pod". By using soup.find_all("article", class_="product_pod"), we extract all elements that match this pattern.
Extract Title and Price:

6)We loop through each book and:
Use book.h3.a["title"] to get the title (found within an <h3> tag).
Use book.find("p", class_="price_color").text.strip() to get the price.
We store each bookâ€™s title and price in a dictionary and add it to our book_data list.

Display the Data:
7)Finally, we print the title and price of each book in our book_data list. This gives us a clean output of all books on the page.
